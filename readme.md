## Introduction

This respository contains files associated with our reanalysis of two 
previously published comparative gene expression studies:

> Levin M, Anavy L, Cole AG, Winter E, Mostov N, Khair S, Senderovich N, Kovalev E, Silver DH, Feder M, et al. 2016. The mid-developmental transition and the evolution of animal body plans. Nature 531: 637-641. [doi:10.1038/nature16994](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature16994)

> Kryuchkova-Mostacci N, Robinson-Rechavi M: Tissue-Specificity of Gene Expression Diverges Slowly between Orthologs, and Rapidly between Paralogs. PLoS Computational Biology 2016, 12:e1005274â€“13. [doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005274](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005274)

The files in this repository include:

- [manuscript.md](./manuscript.md) The rendered manuscript. It is the simplest way to view our manuscript, including the computed results and figures.

- [manuscript.rmd](./manuscript.rmd) The manuscript text and source code for our reanalysis. This is the file we edited as we wrote the manuscript.

- [kmrr](./kmrr) The folder with the data and original code from Kryuchkova-Mostacci Robinson-Rechavi 2016, as well as the products of this code and gene trees that are needed to rerun our analyses.

- [levin_etal](./levin_etal) The folder with data provided by the authors of Levin et al. 2016, as well as our annotations of their analysis and the code we used to explore their results.
